# Cancel-All-Orders-Exploit
This exploit will cancel all active orders on some specific food ordering store.

For the order cancelation message we use something similar to "COMPANYNAME contacted us about the order and said that you eat cows, this is a holy animal so we decided to cancel!" for the purpose of framing COMPANYNAME so that the merchants will blame COMPANYNAME for something which the customers never actually said (Framing).

NOTE: This exploit has been executed in a acceptation environment, the actual company has been informed about the security risks through a responsible disclosure policy.
The code is made this way to proof the impact of Framing and Improper Access Control.
